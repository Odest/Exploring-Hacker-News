    "The data set that will be worked with can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), but note that it has been reduced from 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows from removing submissions that did not receive comments and then random sampling from the remaining submissions. Below breaksdown the columns of the data set.\n",

For the 'Show HN' posts, the time that a post gets the most comments is 6 PM followed by 12 AM, 2 PM, 11 PM, and 10 PM. If we want to convert it to Pacific Standard Time we would have to subtract it by three hours."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the project was to see whether 'Ask HN' or 'Show HN' posts receive more comments on average and then also when comments are posted for the two different posts. From the results we can see that the 'Ask HN' averages more comments at 14 comments compared to the 'Show HN' posts which average to 10. Splitting the two different posts and see when they each receive the most comments on average, it seems users post the most comments at 12 PM PST for 'Ask HN' and 5 PM PST for 'Show HN' posts. Converting the times to PST, almost all the times in the top five for both post types are in the afternoon and evening with the only outlier to be 11 AM PST for 'Show HN' posts. It is safe to conclude with this information that the most user interactions on a post would be a 'Ask HN' post in the later afternoon."
